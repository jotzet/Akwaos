# Akwaos - Aquatic Ecosystem Simulator

This project is a simple game inspired by John Conway's Game of Life. It simulates an aquatic ecosystem where various types of fish interact. Players can introduce different fish species into the environment and observe how they influence the ecosystem.
<br>
The name "Akwaos" combines the Polish prefix "akwa-" meaning water-related, with "chaos" to highlight the unpredictable nature of the system.

# Running the simulation

To start the simulation, run the executable file (`AKWAOS.exe`) provided.

## Modifying the simulation
If you wish to make changes to the simulation, such as adjusting the number of fish or the size of the ecosystem, you can do so by editing the `main.cpp` file. The relevant functions are located at the top of the file and are commented. After making your changes, compile the program by running the make command in the game directory. This will generate a new executable file, which you can then run to start the updated simulation.

## Resetting the simulation
To reset the simulation at any time, press the "R" key on your keyboard.
